# SIGGRAPH Paper auto suggestion system..

This is a trial system for accurate related siggraph paper suggestion.
A user can provide some keyword(select) or provide interested pdf file, and the system will parse it and search some other related, interesting paper for you.

#### Installation

0. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/karpathy/nipspreview.git`

1. Download nips25offline from `http://books.nips.cc/nips25.html` and move it into the folder created in step 0

2. Make sure you have ImageMagick: `sudo apt-get install imagemagick`

3. Run `pdftowordcloud.py` (to generate top words for each paper. Output saved in topwords.p as pickle)

4. Run `pdftothumbs.py` (to generate tiny thumbnails for all papers. Outputs saved in thumbs/ folder)

5. Run `scrape.py` (to generate paperid, title, authors list by scraping NIPS .html page)

6. Run `makecorpus.py` (to create allpapers.txt file that has all papers one per row)

7. Run `python lda.py -f allpapers.txt -k 7 --alpha=0.5 --beta=0.5 -i 100` . This will generate a pickle file called `ldaphi.p` that contains the LDA word distribution matrix. Thanks to this [nice LDA code](https://github.com/shuyo/iir/blob/master/lda/lda.py) by shuyo! It requires nltk library and numpy. In this example we are using 7 categories. You would need to change the `nipsnice_template.html` file a bit if you wanted to try different number of categories.

8. Generate the abstract files inside abstracts/ folder using `getabstracts.py`. Some user interaction may be necessary because of poorly formatted papers that make abstract extraction a pain. See script.

9. Finally, run `generatenicelda.py` (to create the nipsnice.html page)
